# Before-I-Go-Out (BIGO)

This is a Shiny App done for DBA3702 module in NUS on early 2022.

The App primary tracks rainfall data in SG using API data from data.gov and Google Directions API and spatial transformation code in R. The tracked rainfall data helps users to 1) Have an overview of the rainfall situation in Singapore. 2) Get their estimated route delay due to the rain 3) Search for availble carparks surrounding their destination
